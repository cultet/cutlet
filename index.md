    headline: Share a <br><strong>Cutlet</strong>
    content:
      Cutlet is a BEP-20 smart contract designed with a focus on providing need-based resources to those affected due to COVID-19. The protocol was launched on May 5th, 2021 on Binance Smart Chain (referred to as BSC). This token contract employs a static reward system - 9% of every transaction is split into three parts - one part is distributed to the holders, the other 3% is added to the need-based global funding pool, and the rest is used to fuel the liquidity pool on Pancake Swap decentralized exchange. This token was launched with the idea of creating a community token that helps the people in need amidst this pandemic.

    content:
      The static reward system is a concept that was inspired by Safemoon's popular reward system with its sustainable approach towards liquidity distribution. The reward amount is based on the transaction and volume of the tokens in the marketplace. This method also encourages token holders to hold their tokens to earn rewards from transactions based on the contract and the number of tokens held.
